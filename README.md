# Use Infinite Impulse Response Filter to Remove Noise from Real Time Data

# Abstract

The report shows the use of IIR filter to remove noise from real-time data, and use that data for detection. We have successfully created the programs that make it possible.

# Data Acquisation

For this assignment we have used webcam to collect data in real-time. Using the webcam2rgb program real-time data is recorded, which was then split into red, green, and blue signals. These signals were then used for the purpose of the application given below in the report.

# Application

We created a program to detect ambulances, from sirens and blinks of blue and red light. If ambulance detection is possible, it may help to reach its destination as soon as possible. One example is transportation network optimization like adjusting the timing of traffic lights by the detection. Alternatively, if a general vehicle detects it, it may be possible to efficiently give way to an ambulance or prevent an unexpected traffic accident. We made it possible by using webcam and RGB detection.
